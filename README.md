## About This Repository

Welcome to **DSA-Diary** — my personal log of **Data Structures and Algorithms** practice.  
Every entry documents a **question**, its **solution (code)**, and a **deep-dive explanation** into the thought process behind it.

This is not just a repository of answers, but a **learning journal** that helps me — and hopefully others — truly *understand* how algorithms work.

> *Goal:* To build a strong foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking through consistent practice.
